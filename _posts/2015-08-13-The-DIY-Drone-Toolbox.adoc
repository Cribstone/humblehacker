Whether or not you plan to build a 98% DIY Drone or simply want to learn how to make back ups for existing parts, one would be amazed how much you can do with just these few basic building blocks.

== Arduino
 
A microtroller (MCU) chipset specializes in converting analog inputs into digital outputs and vice versa. While there are many different MCU manufacturers, Arduino hardware is specifically oriented towards protyping and experimentation while its programming code is well known for being especially friendly to beginners. They were also one of the first companies to open source their hardware designs along with their source code.  All these factors have combined to make it extremely popular across the creative spectrum from artists to electrical engineers.  Such popularity has in turned spawned an enormous community of user-contributors whose source code creates literally thousands of applications.

Early UAV autopilot platforms like http://www.multiwii.com/ and http://copter.ardupilot.com/ grew out of this very same phenomenon. In fact it could be argued that without Arduino, the modern consumer UAV industry would still be a small niche market for expensive toys as the flight controller concept evolved out of these user-contributor communities.

Arduino boards come in many different variants, with many different features.  By far the most popular variant for DIY Drone applications is known as the Arduino Pro Mini-

These compact 8bit boards can be ordered for as cheap as $3 each and their versatility is such that they could be used to build almost every essential electronic component on a drone (incl. the Flight Controller, Transmitter, Receiver, and even the ESCs!) save the brushless motors! Their usage as Flight Controllers has recently been eclipsed by more powerful 32Bit boards, but they remain important pieces of DIY transmitter/receivers like OpenLRSng and some hardcore DIYers will use them to build DIY ESCs such as the VESC project-http://vedder.se/2015/01/vesc-open-source-esc/.

I will be outlining how to use a Pro Mini in a DIY OpenLRSng RX/TX in a later post.

There are some cases where 8Bits of memory are sufficient, but many more inputs and outputs are required then the compact Arduino Pro Mini can provide.  The massive Arduino Mega2560 was developed for such use cases, and variants of this board are still very much in demand as Multiwii Flight Controllers.

I will be using a Mega2560 to build a DIY Controller/Transmitter with OpenTX firmware in a later post.

== 8bit vs 32bit MCUs 
The majority of 8bit MCUs used in remote control or small autonomous aircraft are based on an AVR architecture https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_AVR.  32bit MCUs are based on an ARM chipset similar to those that power smartphones.  The underlying architecture 

When it comes to a CPU processor like those powering a laptop, more RAM is almost always better.  In an MCU, where performance is measured by its ability to process inputs and outputs from both analog and digital sources, more RAM isn't necessarily going to help.

Nevertheless, the future development of Flight Controllers seems to be firmly 32Bit. Some commercially available Radio Controller/Transmitters such as the Turnigy 9XR Pro have also adopted 32bit processors
