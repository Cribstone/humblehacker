that will be relayed to the drone through the wireless radio transmitter.  Most RC Transmitters allow for a wide variety of autonomous flight modes to be programmed into auxiliary switches.

Real-time telemetry can be sent back to the Control Box using Bluetooth or more advanced RF configurations.

It also performs another important role by translating digital commands from the Flight Controller into raw  electric current to power the Brushless Motors.

The major disadvantage compared to brushed motors are the requirement for additional speed controls.  However, with ESC components getting smarter and cheaper every day, this disadvantage the Brushless Motors.  While only one ESC is needed to power the Flight Controller.
