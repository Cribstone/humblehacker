            <p class="panel-cover__description">For the last decade, Andrew Jawitz has been solving problems with a multidisciplinary approach he describes as &quot;Civic Making&quot;. His academic background involved training in archival database techniques as well as qualitative research through ethnography and oral history. Such a background has greatly informed his current work which approaches open civic data and the &quot;DIY Makers Movement&quot; within the context of place-based egalitarianism. He has been a Brigade Captain in the Code for America organization since 2012 through which he co-founded Code for Maine, a local affiliate in the state of Maine. In this capacity he has successfully coordinated multiple Meetups, hack-a-thons and annual events celebrating National Civic Hack Day in multiple cities across the state of Maine. He has also forged partnerships with local governments in efforts to improve transit service for the City of Bath and assisting the city of Bangor with an Open Data policy. In 2014 he spearheaded a collaboration between Code for Maine, the Public Laboratory for Citizen Science, Friends of Casco Bay and Harpswell Coastal Academy in an effort to develop grassroots techniques for mapping aquatic invasive species with local middle school students. In 2013, he worked closely with young leaders in the Somali diaspora community on various efforts including a collaboration with Ushahidi, Al Jazeera and Souktel called &quot;Somalia Speaks&quot; wherein groups of bi-lingual Somali students around the world were enlisted to translate SMS communications coming from remote famine-affected regions in Somalia. Since 2010, Andrew has been a tireless advocate for improving transit access in rural regions and small cities, spearheading an independent campaign called &quot;Car-Free Maine&quot; before its absorbtion into Code for Maine where it continues to be a flagship program. He has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Five Rivers Arts Alliance and the Maine Film and Video Association and has served on the Traditional Arts Committee for the Maine Arts Commission.
    
    Andrew&#x27;s technological expertise reflects his diverse background and background in design-thinking. He is equally comfortable working with software programmers and electrical engineers and is always seeking to challenge himself with a new software language or microcontroller platform. Accordingly, his development skills favor formats such as Processing, Python, server-side javascript and MQTT for their ability to facilitate broader interactions with the physical domain. Likewise, his experience in interaction design favors platforms like Arduino and embedded Linux (including Raspberry Pi and OpenWRT) for their ability to access the full power of the web in a physical context with minimal configuration.
    
    His work with the civic technology community allows Andrew to apply these skills in embedded interaction design to a broader context. Recent examples include development of an Open Source vehicle tracker for small cities to deploy in snowplows and public transit, and a concept for connecting wearable technology tracking devices to Personal Health Records (PHRs)</p>

<p>I want to build a programmable aerial mapping vehicle that I can use as an interim testbed to refine various DIY/Open Source methods that will eventually be included in a related project for an [affordable mapping drone](<a href="http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/08-05-2014/aerial-mapping-drone-for-under-60" class="bare">http://publiclab.org/notes/code4maine/08-05-2014/aerial-mapping-drone-for-under-60</a>).</p>

<h4 id="_the_100_flying_wing">The -$100 Flying Wing</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project is an outgrowth of, and a complement to an earlier project that sought to build a fully programmable UAV for under $100. To keep costs down, project parameters stipulated that as much of the aircraft as possible should to be constructed out of standardized, off-the-shelf materials including the electronics which were designed around an Arduino Microcontroller and a Gyro-acceleromoter module extracted from a Ninetendo Wii remote. A flying-wing configuration using recycled foam allowed for further efficiency as it required only one motor and speed controller to remain in the air for longer periods.
  That project is still very much in progress and remains the ultimate goal.  However, while I was amazed at how much could be achieved with nothing more than an Arduino pro Mini and a Wiimote, the project reached a critical juncture when it became clear that the 8bit Arduino would not be up to the task of following preprogrammed flight patterns by GPS waypoint. As this capability is central to the task of aerial mapping, the entire project has been forced to go "back to the drawing board"&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_quadcopter">Quadcopter</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As counter-intuitive as it may seem, the simpler design in this case (the flying wing) turned out to be far more difficult than a more technologically complex design like a quadcopter.  In the world of DIY/Open Source, everything depends on there being enough documentation and support for any particular project.  As the quadcopter configuration has become the most popular over the last decade, it is far easier to start from scratch as you can depend on there being ample support from other users whenever a problem is encountered.</p>
