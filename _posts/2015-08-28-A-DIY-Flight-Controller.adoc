= A DIY Flight Controller

Note-For a broad introduction to the most basic, critical components in a DIY Drone build see first this post at- https://cribstone.github.io/humblehacker/2015/08/11/DIY-Drone-Basics.html. 

The Flight Controller (aka autopilot) functions as the robotic "brain" and as such is often the most expensive single piece of hardware in a drone kit (other than the RC Transmitter if one is not already owned). Pioneering open source projects like http://www.multiwii.com/ and http://ardupilot.com/ developed autopilot firmware for 8Bit MCUs like the popular Arduino.  Most platforms at present have evolved into 32bit platforms, usually based on an STM32 MCU.
